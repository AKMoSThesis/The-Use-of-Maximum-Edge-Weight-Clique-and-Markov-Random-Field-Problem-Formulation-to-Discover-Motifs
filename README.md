### This folder contains the three approaches outlined in *The Use of Maximum Edge Weight Clique and Markov Random Field Problem Formulation to Discover Motifs*.

The three approaches used in the thesis are:

1. M_best_ILP (the ***ILP formulation*** based on [*A combinatorial optimization approach for diverse motif finding applications*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1748-7188-1-13)).
2. B_and_B_method (the ***branch-and-bound algorithm*** based on [*A maximum edge-weight clique extraction algorithm based on branch-and-bound*](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/science/article/pii/S1572528620300177?via%3Dihub)).
3. BMMF_method (the ***loopy belief propagation*** based on [*M are better than one: an ensemble-based motif finder and its application to regulatory element prediction*](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/7/868/211358) and [*Finding the M Most Probable Configurations Using Loopy Belief Propagation*](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2003/file/70fcb77e6349f4467edd7227baa73222-Paper.pdf)).
